The Luciad icon font is created using the Icomoon app.

To modify this font, go to https://icomoon.io/app/ and create a new project.

After creating a new project, add the file "samples/resources/font/{$fontname}/selection.json" to your project using the "import icons" button.

Once the icon font is imported, you can freely deselect, edit or remove icons you don't need.

You can also add your own icons to your project (using the "import icons") or add icons from one of Icomoon's standard libraries (using the "icon library" button).

When finished, select "generate font" at the bottom right, adjust your settings and generate a new, custom font (using the "download" button at the bottom right).
